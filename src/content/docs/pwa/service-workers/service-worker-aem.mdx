# Understanding the Goal

The goal is to enable offline capabilities and improve performance by registering a Service Worker in your AEM-powered website. We'll separate the registration logic from the Service Worker's core functionality for better organization and maintainability.

## Step 1: Create the `sw-registration` Component

**Purpose:** This component handles the registration of the Service Worker.

**Location:** Inside your AEM project's `ui.apps` module, under the `apps` folder, create a new folder named `sw-registration`. The full path might look like:

```
/apps/your-project/components/sw-registration
```

**Structure:** Inside the `sw-registration` folder, create at least:

- `js.html` (for the registration script)
- `.content.xml` (for component definition)

## Step 2: Create `js.html` in `sw-registration`

This file contains the JavaScript code to register the Service Worker.

```js
if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener("load", function () {
    navigator.serviceWorker
      .register("/sw/sw.js")
      .then(function (registration) {
        console.log("ServiceWorker registered with scope:", registration.scope);
      })
      .catch(function (err) {
        console.log("ServiceWorker registration failed:", err);
      });
  });
}
```

### Explanation

- Checks if the `serviceWorker` API is supported.
- Registers the Service Worker after the page loads.
- Uses `.then()` and `.catch()` to handle success and failure.

## Step 3: Create the `sw` Component

**Purpose:** This component serves the Service Worker file.

**Location:** Inside your AEM project's `ui.apps` module:

```
/apps/your-project/components/sw
```

**Structure:** Inside the `sw` folder, create:

- `js.html` (for the Service Worker logic)
- `.content.xml` (for component definition)

## Step 4: Create `js.html` in `sw`

This file contains the Service Worker logic.

```js
self.addEventListener("install", function (event) {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open("v1").then(function (cache) {
      return cache.addAll([
        "/",
        "/content/your-project/home.html",
        "/etc.clientlibs/your-project/clientlibs/site/resources/style.css",
        "/etc.clientlibs/your-project/clientlibs/site/resources/script.js",
      ]);
    })
  );
});

self.addEventListener("fetch", function (event) {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then(function (response) {
      return response || fetch(event.request);
    })
  );
});
```

### Explanation

- `install` event caches specified assets.
- `fetch` event serves cached resources when available.

## Step 5: Create Content Nodes

**Purpose:** To make the components accessible via URLs.

**Location:** Inside the `ui.content` module:

```
/content/your-project-name/sw
/content/your-project-name/sw-registration
```

## Step 6: Set `sling:resourceType` for `sw`

**Configuration:**

- In `/content/sw`, add a property:
  - `sling:resourceType` = `your-project/components/sw`

## Step 7: Set `sling:resourceType` for `sw-registration`

**Configuration:**

- In `/content/sw-registration`, add a property:
  - `sling:resourceType` = `your-project/components/sw-registration`

## Step 8: Load `sw-registration` Script in `header.html`

Include the Service Worker registration script on every page:

```html
<script src="/sw-registration.js"></script>
```

## Step 9: Configure AEM Dispatcher

To load the Service Worker from the domain level, add the following rewrite rules in the dispatcher:

- **Request:** `/sw-registration.js`
  **Rewrite to:** `/content/your-project-name/sw-registration.js`
- **Request:** `/sw.js`
  **Rewrite to:** `/content/your-project-name/sw.js`

## Important Notes

- **Client Libraries:** Ensure Service Worker and cached resources are correctly included.
- **HTTPS Required:** Service Workers need HTTPS (except on localhost).
- **Scope:** Placement of `sw.js` determines scope. Place in root for full site control.
- **Caching Strategies:** Adjust caching strategies for production (e.g., network-first, stale-while-revalidate).
- **AEM Dispatcher:** Ensure it allows `/sw-registration.js` and `/sw.js`.
- **Debugging:** Use browser DevTools (`Application` tab) to inspect and debug.

By following these steps, your AEM project will have Service Worker support for offline capabilities and performance improvements. Adapt configurations as needed.
