# Setting Up a Website as a PWA

Before diving into the details, here's a quick overview of the steps you'll follow to transform a regular website into a **Progressive Web App (PWA):**

- **Ensure HTTPS** – PWAs require a secure connection for security and access to advanced features.
- **Create a Web App Manifest** – Define how your PWA looks and behaves when installed.
- **Register a Service Worker** – Enable offline support and caching.
- **Enable Install Prompt** – Allow users to install the PWA to their devices.
- **Deploy the PWA** – Host your PWA on a secure public server like Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase.

Once these steps are complete, your PWA will be **installable, offline-ready, and feel like a native app**.

Now, let's go step by step and build a working PWA!

<Steps>

### Ensure Your Website is HTTPS Enabled

PWAs require a secure connection (HTTPS) to protect user data and enable features like Service Workers.

How to do it?

- If you're using a hosting service, enable SSL (Secure Socket Layer).
- If you're hosting on Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase, HTTPS is enabled by default.
- If using Apache or Nginx, obtain an SSL certificate via Let's Encrypt.

### Setting Up Icons and Manifest File

**What is a manifest file ?**

The manifest.json in PWAs enables installation and defines the app's appearance, including icons, names, and display modes, making it look and feel like a native app. It specifies the start_url for launch behavior, ensuring a consistent user experience. Additionally, it allows developers to create app shortcuts for quick access to key features, further enhancing usability. In essence, it's the configuration file that elevates a website to a seamless, app-like experience.

In simpler terms, the manifest.json file is the PWA's identity card. It tells the operating system and browser: "This is a PWA, and this is how it should look and behave "

To make your PWA installable and look great on different devices, you need a Web App Manifest and properly sized icons. You have two options:

**Manual Setup**

- You can manually create the `manifest.json` file in the root of your project and generate icons in different sizes:
- Create icons in multiple sizes (192x192, 512x512, etc.)
- Place these icons inside a folder like /public/icons/

```js filename="manifest.json"
{
  "name": "My PWA App",
  "short_name": "PWA App",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#007bff",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-512x512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}

```

 Explanation of key properties:

- name & short_name – App name displayed on the home screen.
- start_url – The first page the app loads when opened.
- display: standalone – Makes the app run independently, outside the browser.
- theme_color & background_color – Defines the UI colors.
- icons – App icons for different screen sizes.

</Callout>

**Use an Online Generator (Easier)**

If you don’t want to manually resize and create icons, use this free tool:

[**PWA Icon Generator**](https://pwa-icon-generator.vercel.app/)

- Upload a high-resolution image (**1024x1024** recommended).
- It will generate all required icon sizes and a complete **manifest file** for you.
- Download the generated assets and add them to your project.

Add the manifest to your HTML file:

In the `<head>` section of your `index.html`, add:

```html filename="index.html"
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" />
```

### Register a Service Worker

Service workers are scripts that run in the background, enabling features like offline support and push notifications. They act as a proxy between the browser and network

The details of their lifecycle and coding will be elaborated in the following sections.

Inorder to register a service for our pwa

- Create a new file: public/sw.js

- Add this basic Service Worker script:

```js filename="sw.js"
self.addEventListener("install", (event) => {
  console.log("Service Worker installing...");
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open("pwa-cache").then((cache) => {
      return cache.addAll(["/", "/index.html", "/styles.css", "/script.js"]);
    })
  );
});

self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then((response) => {
      return response || fetch(event.request);
    })
  );
});
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
 What this does:

- install event – Caches the homepage, CSS, and JavaScript.

- fetch event – Serves cached files when offline.

</Callout>

- Register the Service Worker in index.html:

```html filename="index.html"
<script>
  if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker
      .register("/sw.js")
      .then(() => console.log("Service Worker Registered"))
      .catch((error) =>
        console.log("Service Worker Registration Failed:", error)
      );
  }
</script>
```

<Callout type="default">
  Inorder to check whether service worker is installed or not follow the below steps

- Open the devtools of your browser for eg. chrome
- Open the application Tab of the desired browser
- navigate to Service Worker section
- check if its registered or not

</Callout>

### Enable Install Prompt

To allow users to install the PWA, listen for the install event.

- Add this script to index.html:

```html filename="index.html"
<script>
  let deferredPrompt;
  window.addEventListener("beforeinstallprompt", (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    deferredPrompt = event;
    document.getElementById("install-btn").style.display = "block";
  });

  document.getElementById("install-btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
    deferredPrompt.prompt();
  });
</script>
```

- Add a button in HTML to trigger installation:

```html filename="index.html"
<button id="install-btn" style="display: none;">Install App</button>
```

Now, users will see an Install Prompt when they visit your PWA.

Voila!!! , you just created your first pwa ..

### Deploy Your PWA

To make your PWA accessible to users, it must be hosted on a **public HTTPS server**. Below are some popular deployment options:

- **Netlify** – Simply drag and drop your project or use `netlify-cli`.
- **Vercel** – Deploy effortlessly with the `vercel` CLI.
- **GitHub Pages** – A great option for hosting static PWAs.
- **Firebase Hosting** – Ideal for real-time and dynamic PWAs.

**Testing Your PWA Installation**

Once deployed, follow these steps to verify that your PWA is installable:

1. Open your site in **Google Chrome**.
2. Open **DevTools** (Right-click → Inspect or `F12`).
3. Navigate to the **Lighthouse** tab.
4. Run a **PWA audit** to check compliance.
5. If all requirements are met, Chrome will display an **Install** button.

With your PWA deployed and installable, users can now enjoy a seamless, app-like experience! 🎉
