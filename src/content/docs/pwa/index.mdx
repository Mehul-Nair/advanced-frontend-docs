# What are Progressive Web Apps?

Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are web apps built and enhanced with modern APIs to provide enhanced capabilities while still reaching any web user on any device with a single codebase. They combine the broad reach of web apps with the rich capabilities of platform-specific apps to enhance the user experience.

## [The Three Pillars of PWA Design](https://web.dev/articles/what-are-pwas#pillars)

To create a PWA that matches the experience of a platform-specific app, it should be capable, reliable, and installable.

### Capable â€“ Web Apps Can Do More Than Ever

Web apps today can do almost everything that traditional apps can. In the past, if you wanted to use **video calls, GPS location, or notifications**, you needed to install a specific app on your phone or computer. But now, websites can do all of this **without needing a download**.

For example:

- You can **make a video call** directly from a web app, just like in Zoom or Google Meet.
- Websites can **track your location** to give you directions, like Google Maps.
- You can **get notifications** from a web app, just like when you receive a message on WhatsApp.

The web is getting even more powerful. Developers can now use advanced coding tools (like **WebAssembly**) to make web apps **faster and more efficient**, so they feel as smooth as traditional apps.

### Reliable â€“ Works Even With a Bad Connection

A great web app should **always work**, even if your internet is slow or completely offline.

Imagine this:

- You're reading an article, but you lose internet. A **good web app** will let you keep reading without interruption.
- You book a flight, and the ticket is saved in the app. Even if you're offline, you should **still be able to see your ticket**.
- If something goes wrong (like no internet), the app should **tell you whatâ€™s happening** instead of just freezing or failing.

Studies show that if a page **takes too long to load**, people will leave. Thatâ€™s why PWAs are built to be **fast, responsive, and always available**, even in poor network conditions.

### Installable â€“ Add Web Apps Like Regular Apps

A PWA can be **installed** on your phone or computer **just like any other app**, so you donâ€™t have to keep opening your browser.

For example:

- You can **add a web app to your home screen** and open it with **one tap**, just like an installed app.
- The app **opens in its own window** instead of a browser tab, making it feel more like a real app.
- It can **integrate with your system**, letting you use shortcuts or even handle certain file types.

This makes PWAs **feel more natural to use** and lets you switch between them quicklyâ€”just like regular apps on your phone or laptop.
